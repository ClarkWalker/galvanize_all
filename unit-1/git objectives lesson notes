making changes
    add         -- takes a file as an argument and adds it to be committed
        add as opposed to commit...?
    commit -m   -- follows up on add and actually makes the changes added by add
        locally right...? or is it to gitHub

gitHub
    push        -- up to git hub
        args?
    pull        -- pulls down a version and updates the local repo
        local versions? args?

confirmation
    status      -- shows the status
        what else...?
