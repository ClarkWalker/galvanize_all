# Q1 Project Proposal


## Project Description
Caesar cypher app.  A Caesar cypher is a basic system of encryption that involves 'shifting' the letters in a message +n or -n to obfuscate of the message an
example of this is
* 'hello world' -1 becomes 'gdkkn vnqkn'
* 'hello world' +1 becomes 'ifmmp xpsme'
You may be able to deduce, that this is a simple form of encryption that can be
calculated by a human being in a relatively short amount of time and as such is
not a highly secure method of communication.

## What problem does your project solve?
If you need a weak ass encryption then this app is for you!
I see this app as a toy, something fun to play with or learn about basic
encryption methods.

## Who has this problem?
It could be used by teachers or students for
learning/teaching. Or by people who want to make a 'weak' encryption for fun

## How will your project solve this problem?
By performing a 'Caesar cypher shift' to text that a user supplies

## What inputs does it need?
* the user needs to input text to be encrypted
* the user needs to select a number between -13 to 13 (26 letters...) to be used as the number of letters shifted forwards (positive) or backwards (negative)
* a button to encrypt the user-supplied text

## What outputs does it produce?
encrypted text

## What web API(s) will it use?
I literally can't think of any that I would need to use to do this.
I am open to Ideas though. Thoughts..?
:P

## What technologies do you plan to use?
* Caesar Cypher algorithm
* HTML
  * an HTML validator TBD
* native CSS
  * a CSS validator TBD
* Materialize for a front end CSS framework
* native JavaScript
  * a JavaScript Linter TBD
* Firebase to deploy the site

## Feature list
text field number field and a button to encrypt the text!
possibly a cute-animal/Chuck-Noris-Quotes generator for an API req.
